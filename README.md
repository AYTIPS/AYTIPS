### 🌍 What I do

I build the *boring but critical* plumbing that makes healthcare and dental AI actually usable in real life:

- PMS ↔ CRM integrations (Open Dental, Dentrix, GoHighLevel, etc.)
- Event-driven automations for appointments, patients, billing & ops data  
- APIs and backend services using FastAPI, Python and PostgreSQL
- Sync engines that handle retries, rate limits, and bad data without breaking production
- Foundations for AI & machine learning: clean, well-modeled data instead of spreadsheet chaos

My sweet spot is multi-location practices and DSOs that want real-time visibility into
no-shows, phantom capacity, production, and patient journeys – and then want to use AI + automation to predict and improve those metrics.

### 🧠 AI, Data & Automation focus

- Predictive models for no-shows / late cancels and phantom capacity
- Pipelines that feed LLM/AI agents with structured, governed ops data
- Automations that write back into PMS/CRM so staff don’t have to
- Feature engineering around patient behavior, provider utilization, and schedule patterns
- Serving predictions back into daily workflows (not just dashboards)

###  Selected projects (high level)

| Project | What it does | Stack |
| ------ | ------------ | ----- |
| Open Dental ↔ CRM Sync | Bi-directional sync of patients, appointments, and status changes between Open Dental and a marketing CRM. Handles rate limits, deduping, retries, and dead-letter queues. | Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, webhooks |
| Phantom Capacity Engine | Tracks no-shows, late cancels, and unused chair time across locations to surface hidden capacity and feed predictive models + automations. | Python, FastAPI, schedulers, Postgres |
| Ops Data API for DSOs | Unified API over multiple clinics’ PMS data so operators and CFOs can see real-time production, collections, and provider utilization without touching raw databases.
| Python, FastAPI, SQL, background jobs |

### 📌 What I’m interested in

- Building infrastructure and automations for dental & healthtech AI platforms  
- Making PMS data clean, real-time, and AI-ready  
- Working with teams who care about reliability, observability, and long-term maintainability

### 🤝 Let’s connect

If you’re:

- a dental/healthtech startup trying to make sense of messy PMS data for AI/automation, or  
- a DSO / multi-clinic group that wants better scheduling, billing, or predictive insights…

…I’d love to talk.
